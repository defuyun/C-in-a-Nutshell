# Framework Fundalmentals

## Char

.NET characters are by default UTF-16, which supports most usage. But some characters require 2 UTF-16 to represent therefore some some characters use a utf32 format.

in a C# string you can have both utf16 character and utf32 character, mixed together to form one string. this presents some problem, for example the `length` of a string does not exactly equate it's memory count, since some characters can be utf32.

## Enums

the `[Flag]` attribute in Enum allows the Enum value to be treated as group, e.g.

```C#
public enum BorderSide{Left = 1, Right = 2, Bottom = 4, Top = 8};
BorderSide b = BorderSide.Left | BorderSide.Right;
Console.WriteLine(b) // 3

[Flag] public enum BorderSide{Left = 1, Right = 2, Bottom = 4, Top = 8};
BorderSide b = BorderSide.Left | BorderSide.Right;
Console.WriteLine(b) // Left,Right
```

by adding flag, the composite of `Left,Right` is treated as a collection of flags
