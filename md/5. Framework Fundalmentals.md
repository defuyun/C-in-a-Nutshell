# Framework Fundalmentals

## Char

.NET characters are by default UTF-16, which supports most usage. But some characters require 2 UTF-16 to represent therefore some some characters use a utf32 format.

in a C# string you can have both utf16 character and utf32 character, mixed together to form one string. this presents some problem, for example the `length` of a string does not exactly equate it's memory count, since some characters can be utf32.

## Enums

the `[Flag]` attribute in Enum allows the Enum value to be treated as group, e.g.

```C#
public enum BorderSide{Left = 1, Right = 2, Bottom = 4, Top = 8};
BorderSide b = BorderSide.Left | BorderSide.Right;
Console.WriteLine(b) // 3

[Flag] public enum BorderSide{Left = 1, Right = 2, Bottom = 4, Top = 8};
BorderSide b = BorderSide.Left | BorderSide.Right;
Console.WriteLine(b) // Left,Right
```

by adding flag, the composite of `Left,Right` is treated as a collection of flags

### How Enums Work

in the CLR there is no runtime difference between an unboxed enum, meaning you don't do this

```C#
enum Color {};

Color c;
object cd = c;
```

and it's underlying integral value. an Enum defition in CLR is merely a subtype of `System.Enum` (but still a type not an actual integral) with static integral fields for each member

## Equality Comparison

This section explores 2 questions:

1. When are `==` and `!=` adequate to use
2. When should you customize `Equals` method

`==` and `!=` has 2 meanings depending on the context

1. Value equality: this happens when you compare value types, (int, float, struct)
2. Reference equality: this happens when yuou compare reference types, (object)

by default, structs use `structural equality`, a special kind of equality where it does per field comparison

### Standard Equality Protocol

1. `==` and `!=`
2. virtual `Equals` method in `object`
3. `IEquatable<T>` intereface
4. `IStructuralEquatable` interface discussed not here

#### Equals

if we did

```C#
object x = 5;
object y = 5;

x == y; // false
```

since unbox happened reference equality will be checked and since they don't point to same address it's gonna return false;

therefore we use the `Equals` method

```C#
object x = 5;
object y = 5;

x.Equals(y); // true
```

`Equals` is resovled at runtime which resolves `object's` real type `Int32`, then calls `Int32`'s `Equals` method

in general `Equals` performs the same as `==` and `!=`, but resolves the comparison at runtime,

so if at runtime you object resolves to a reference type that does not overload `Equals` then reference equality will be checked

an alternative to `Equals` for null safe operation is to call the _static_ function in `object` class

```C#
object.Equals(x,y);
```

this function is just an alternative to

```C#
x.Equals(y);
```

but safer as the first one does not throw an exception when `x` is null

there is another _static_ function in `objects` that you can use to force `Reference Equality`

```C#
object.ReferenceEquals(x,y);
```

this will force reference equality no matter the type of `x,y`

#### IEquatable\<T\>

The consequence of calling `object.Equal` is that is forces boxing on the combining values, which is a heavy process when `x,y` are value types. I don't understand what followed

## Environment

the static `System.Environment` class provides a range of properties just like `sys` in python

### Files and Folders

* `CurrentDirectory`
* `SystemDirectory`
* `CommandLine`

### Computer and OS

* `MachineName`
* `ProcessorCount`
* `OSVersion`
* `NewLine`

### User login

* `UserName`
* `UserInteractive` (if the user can interact, this can be detected like, if the user is a IIS server it can't iteract, but if running from a desktop machine the user can)
* `UserDomainName`

### Diagnostics

* `TickCount`
* `StackTrace`
* `WorkingSet` (get the amount of physical memory mapped to the process context), refer to this [what is workingset](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3378874/environment-workingset-incorrectly-reports-memory-usage) and another [link](7.%20WSS.md)
* `Version`

`Environment` contains other variable you can find by typing `set` on the `cmd`
