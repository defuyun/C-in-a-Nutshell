# Creating Types in C\#

## Expression-Bodied Methods

in C# 7.0 you can use javascript arrow functions

```C#
int Foo(int x) {return x * 2;}
```

can be rewritten as

```C#
int Foo(int x) => x * 2;
```

this works for constructor as well

## Pass by value and Pass by reference

when overloading, pass by value can coexist with pass by reference but not between pass by reference e.g.

```C#
void Foo(int x) {}
void Foo(ref int x) {} // Ok so far
void Foo(out int x) {} // compile error cannot have ref and out at the same time
```

Personally I consider this weird since you need to use the keywords `ref` and `out` when passing the pararmter so it's not hard to infer which overload I'm trying to call

## Deconstructors

C# Deconstructor is for outputing value, basically used to assign values e.g.

```C#
class Rectangle {
    public readonly float Width, Height;
    public Rectangle(float width, float height) {
        Width = width;
        Height = height;
    }

    public void Deconstruct(out float width, out float height) {
        width = Width;
        height = Height;
    }
}

void Main(string[] args)
{
    Rectangle rect = new Rectangle(10.0f, 12.0f);
    var (w,h) = rect;

    System.Console.WriteLine(rect.Width + " " + rect.Height);
    System.Console.WriteLine(w + " " + h);
}
```

this outputs

```md
10 12
10 12
```

do note it does not actually destroy the object, just a shorthand for assigning values

## Getter, Setter and Indexer

the setter has an implicit varaible called `value` that is passed in, it's value is equal to whatever the rhs of = is

note one interesting thing

```C#
class Rectangle {
    int number;

    public int Number {
        get {
            System.Console.WriteLine("Enter getter");
            return number;
        }

        set {
            System.Console.WriteLine("Enter setter");
            number = value;
        }
    }
}

void Main(string[] args)
{
    Rectangle rect = new Rectangle();
    rect.Number = 10;
    rect.Number -= 3;
}
```

in the code I did `rect.Number -= 3` this first triggered the getter, then minus 3, then called the setter with `value = original value - 3`

when CLR process getter and setter it first converts it into `get_XXX` and `set_XXX`, this is during the compiling step and IL are outputed

then these nonvirtual property accessors are inlined by the JIT compiler so in the end no function call is done and everything is the same as if we just accessed the fields themselves

some tricks you can do with setter and getter (property accessor) is limit the access to the variable

e.g. by doing

```C#
public int Number {get;} = 99;
```

* you have limited access to get only while setting the value to 99 (with field initalizer)
* this way no one can change the value, essentially creating a readonly variable

## Constants

the constant keyword on variables is treated exactly the same as constants that never have their address taken in C++, the values are substituted at compile time to the literal number

## Static Constructor

Static class Constructor (or static constructor) is ran only once per type, just before the type is envoked. By envoked I mean

```C#
class Test {
    static Test() {}
}
```

* Instantiating the type
* Accessing a static member in the type

as you can see static constructor does not mean static class

## Partial Types

the partial keyword allows you to split the class definition into 2 seperate files, basically multiple edits are possible. Also possible to be put on functions thus allowing header - implementation divide e.g.

```C#
// paymentForm.cs
partial class PaymentForm {
    partial validatePayment (decimal amount);
}

// paymentForm2.cs
partial class PaymentForm {
    partial validatePayment (decimal amount) {
        if (amount ....)
    }
}
```

in the example we used partial to seperate the files, a thing to note is that there is no return type specified, just partial that's because partial method only works for void

## Polymorthism

The `as` operator performs a downcast that evaluates to `null` if it fails. if you force downcast you will get `InvalidCastException` so decide what you use based on the need.

* it does not work on custom conversion
* it does not work on numeric e.g. `3 as long` would yield an compile time error

The `is` operator tests whether a reference conversion would succeed, in other words whether an object derives from a specified class

* returns true for unboxing conversion

from C# 7.0 you can combine the 2 operators by

```C#
if (a is Stock s)
    Console.WriteLine(s.SharesOwned);
```

so this combines `is` and `as` and it remains in-scope outside the `if` statement

## Boxing and Unboxing

When you cast a value type to object, CLR must perform some special work to bridge the difference in semantics between value and reference type. since value are by value and object (class) is by reference, this process of converting is called boxing and unboxing

```C#
int x = 9;
object obj = x;
```

in the example we are doing a boxing

## The GetType and typeof

All types in C# at runtime is an instance of System.Type. To get this type we can use

* Call `GetType` on the instance
* Use `typeof` operator on the type name

`GetType` is resolved at runtime
`typeof` is evaluated statically at compile time, when generic type is involved it resolved by the JIT Compiler

## Accessibility

be default C# class, functions are marked as `internal` which is only visible to classes in the same assembly (usually assembly is compiled per file, depends on how many file you compile together)

when overriding a base class function, accessibility must be identicial to the original function, so when you override a `public` function you must define it as `public`

e.g.

```C#
class BaseClass { protected virtual void Foo(); }
class SubClass : BaseClass {protected override void Foo(); }
class SubSubClass : BaseClass {public override void Foo(); } // Error, it needs to be protected
```

The exception is when overriding `protected internal` in another assembly, in which case the override is simply `protected`

* note this is only for `protected`, because for starter if it's simply `internal` you can't even inherit it, the `protected` property allows you to inherit it even in a different assembly
* however you can just directly access the class (use it) in a different assembly. only inherit it

An implicity implemented interface it by default `sealed`, so

```C#
public interface IUndoable { void Undo(); }

public class TextBox : IUndoable {
    public void Undo() => Console.WriteLine("TextBox.Undo");
}

public class RichTextBox : TextBox {
    public override void Undo() => ... // this does not work as Undo is sealed
}
```

you need to mark the method as `virtual` or `abstract` in the implementation

## Interfaces and Boxing

converting a struct to an interface causes boxing, (which implicitly means struct can implement interface)

* calling an implicitly implemented function on the struct does not cause boxing
* converting the struct to interface causes boxing

e.g.

```C#
interface I { void Foo(); }
struct S : I {public void Foo(); } // implicitly implmemented Foo

S s = new S();
s.Foo() // no boxing here

I i = s; // boxing
```

## Generic Type

### typeof and Unbound Generic Type

there is no open generic type (generic types where the type is not defined) at runtime only closed ones (e.g. `A<int>`), but it's possible for ~unbound~ generic type to exist at runtime. What this is is as follows

```C#
class A<T> {}
class A<T1, T2> {}

Type a1 = typeof(A<>); // no type defined this is a unbound generic type where you just have the type
Type a2 = typeof(A<,>); // use , to specify multiple param
```

### default Generic type

you can use the `default` keyword to get a default value for the type

```C#
T a = default(T);
```

for reference value this will be `null`, for value type it will be bitwise zeroed value

### Generic Constraints

you can add generic constraints to `T`, this is nothing special, but you can use class __class constraint__ and __struct constraint__ to specify `T` must be a reference type or value type, an example is

```C#
System.Nullable<T> where T : struct {...}
```

* this specifies that `T` must be value type

the __parameterless constructor constraint__ requires `T` to have a public parameterless constructor, meaning we can directlye do `T a = new T()` and there won't be any errors, example

```C#
static void Foo(out T a) where T : new() {
    a = new T();
}
```

### Static Data

static data is unique for each closed type (as in C++)

## Type Parameters and Conversion

C#'s cast operator e.g. `T a = (T) a` can perform 4 kinds of conversion

1. Numeric Conversion (from number to number)
2. Reference Conversion (from ref type to another ref type)
3. Boxing/Unboxing
4. CUstom Conversion (not yet discussed)

The desicion as to what conversion happens is done at compile time, based on the __known__ types of the operands. this creates issues with generic type as at compile time the actual type is not known, so with cases like

```C#
StringBuilder Foo<T> (T arg) {
    if (arg is StringBuilder) {
        return (StringBuilder) arg;
    }
}
```

this gives compile error as the compiler, not knowing what `T` is, is concerned you might be doing a __custom conversion__ (which will be discussed later, hopefully), so there is 2 conversions that could happen and the compiler got confused, one solution is to use `as` opertor since this is for reference conversion only.

the more general solution is to first cast the `arg` into `object`, this workds because `object` is the base for all types in C# and anyting can cast to it. so casting to `object` is assumed to not be custom conversion.

then we have a known type `object`, so we can then apply the casting

```C#
StringBuilder Foo<T> (T arg) {
    if (arg is StringBuilder) {
        return (StringBuilder) (object) arg;
    }
}
```

same for value types, if we want to convert something to int

```C#
int Foo<T> (T x) => (int) (object) x;
```

* since if we jsut did `(int) x`, this could be numeric converison, unboxing or custom conversion.
* I do realize that converting from `x` to `object` may by boxing, so maybe boxing is treated the same as ref conversion

## Covariance and Contravariance

assumming class `A` is convertible to class `B`, (meaning either `A` implements `B` or `A` inherits `B`)

and we have a genric type `X<T>`

`T` is said to be a covariant type parameter if we can convert `X<A>` to `X<B>`

normally you can't just convert like this, for example

if you have the following classes

```C#
class Animal {...};
class Bear : Animal {};
class Camel : Animal {};

public class Stack<T> {
    public void push(T obj);
    public T pop();
}
```

and you wrote this snippet to demonstrate covariant

```C#
Stack<Bear> bears = new Stack<Bear>;
Stack<Animal> animals = bear;
```

this doens't work, and the reason you don't want this to be legal is you don't want to be able to push camel into the stack, so

you don't want this to be legal

```C#
animals.push(new Camel());
```

because `animals` is still a `Bear` stack, this makes methods like

```C#
public static void Wash(Stack<Animal> animals) {...}
```

unable to take parameters in the form of `Wash(bears);`

we can overcome this issue by doing

```C#
public static void Wash(Stack<T> animals) where T : Animal {...}
```

using the base-class constraint, but C# introduced convariant to over this issue

basically to overcome this issue we want to make sure `Camel` does not get pushed into `animals`, in other words the generic class only __outputs__ type not __input__ type

so in C# to specify that the generic class has a convariant parameter we use the `out` keyword, e.g.

```C#
public interface IPoppable<out T> { T Pop(); }
```

the `out` keyword specifies that the methods in this interface only outputs `T`, thus we don't have to worry about it storing any `T`, or in other words, it will only output what it already has

so to use it we make `Stack` implement this method

```C#
public class Stack<T> : IPoppable<out T> {
    public T Pop();
}
```

and in the `Wash` function we do

```C#
public static void Wash(IPoppable<Animal> animals) {...}
```

we can pass in `Stack<Bear>` or `Stack<Camel>` into this function, because `T` is `out` for this interface, it's impossible we push a `Bear` into `Camel` stack or the other way around

Covariance only works when `T` is ref type

the opposite of Covariance is Contravariance, it when we want to use `Animal` in a `Bear` parameter, in this case our input is `Animal` which can be `Bear` or `Camel`, we pass it into a function that takes `Bear` parameter, this means we should not __output__ from `Animal` since the output can be `Bear` or `Camel` and this may break the function, but we can __input__ `Bear` into this stack

thus for Contravariance paramter we use the `in` keyword, e.g.

```C#
public interface IPushable<in T> { void Push(); }
```

so in summary

* if we want to pass `Child` into `Parent` param we use the `out` keyword, this is called covariance
* if we want to pass `Parent` into `Child` param we use the `in` keyword, this is called contravariance

## C# Genric and C++ template

C# generic can be compiled into library with the open type just as is, in C++ template only exists as source code, you can't produce a libraray with template

this works for C# because synthesis between producer (the generic) and producer (code that actually instansiate a generic class with defined type) doens't happen till runtime

* my understanding is that C# compiles generic code into IL as open type
* then the JIT will produce the closed type when it's actually used
