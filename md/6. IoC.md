# Inversion of Control (IoC), Dependency Injection

IoC, oftened seen with the list

* IoC

* IoC container

## Inversion of Control

IoC is a design _principle_ that looks to __inverse__ control in object oriented programming.

* control means any additional responsiblity that a class has other than it's main objective. for example creating the dependent classes.

this itself does not explain much, basically we want loose coupling and the concept is similar to a factory pattern

## Dependency Inversion Principle

DIP (_principle_) suggests that high-level modules should not be dependent on low-level modules but should depend on abstraction.

so a filesystem class should implement on a disk abstraction rather than a disk class, in other words it should not have control over what disk it's gonna get

## Dependency Injection

DI is a _pattern_ that implements IoC _principle_

## IoC Container

The IoC Container is a framework that aims to automate the DI process. Such as the _Unity_ framework in .NET

we cannot achieve loosely coupled classes by only using IoC _principle_ (as it doens't make much sense in itself)
