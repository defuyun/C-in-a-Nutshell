# Collections

The types in the framework for eollections can be divided into the following categories

1. __Interfaces__ that defined standard collections protocols
2. Ready-to-use collection classes (lists, dicts, etc)
3. Base classes for wreiting application-specific collections

so in summary, base classes you need to inherit, interface you need to implement, fully implemented class to use

## Enumeration

there are 2 interfaces

1. Enumerator
2. Enumerable

they both support generic types

the Enumerator is like a C++ iterator, it looks like

```C#
public interface IEnumerator {
    bool MoveNext();
    object Current {get;}
    void Reset();
}
```

`Collections` usually implement `Enumerable`, which contains the function

```C#
public interafec IEnumerable {
    IEnumerator GetEnumerator();
}
```

`IEnumerator` inherits from `IDisposable`, (so there is a function that will clean resources up)

when you do

```C#
foreach(var element in SomeEnumerable) {}
```

it translates to

```C#
using (var rator = SomeEnumerable.GetEnumerator()) {
    while(rator.MoveNext()) {
        var element = rator.Current;
    }
}
```

with `using` the `IDispoble` method will be called once it leaves scope

by order of implementation

`IList` implements `ICollection` implements `IEnumerable`

where each layer contributes more methods

one thing about this is the genric interface does not inherit from the non-generic, they are seperate interfaces, one reason is to avoid having override like having both

```C#
Add(object obj);

Add(T obj);
```

## Arrays

when we use `Array` in C#, they get implicited subtyped (so like the interaface array you've seen in C++), C# creates from a generic type with template params `type, length` in the CLR using a generic collection interaface such as `IList<string>`

the CLR also assign contiguous space in memory for array type to fasten indexed access.

The `Array` class stores value for value-type and reference (pointer) for reference type.

so each reference type takes 4 `byte` while value type takes the type amount.

## BitArray

uses 1bit per object, better than `bool[] bits`

## Other topics mentioned that might have revisit value

* `IReadOnlyList<T>`
* Copying `Array` with `ConstrainedCopy` (performs atomic operation) and `AsReadOnly` returns a wrapper that prevents elements from being reassigned
* `Array.ConvertAll(a, a => Convert.ToInt32(r))` group foreach convert
* Customizable Collections and Proxies
* IEqualityComparer (switches in nondefault equality and hashing behaviour)
* IStructuralEquatable and IStructuralComparable (for structs to compare by field)
