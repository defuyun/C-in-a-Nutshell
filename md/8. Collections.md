# Collections

The types in the framework for eollections can be divided into the following categories

1. __Interfaces__ that defined standard collections protocols
2. Ready-to-use collection classes (lists, dicts, etc)
3. Base classes for wreiting application-specific collections

so in summary, base classes you need to inherit, interface you need to implement, fully implemented class to use
