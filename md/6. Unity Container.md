# .NET Unity Container

IoC, Inversion of Control. Oftened seen with the list

* IoC
* Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
* Dependency Injection (DI)
* IoC container

## Summary

1. IoC is a design _principle_ that looks to __inverse__ control in object oriented programming.

    * control means any additional responsiblity that a class has other than it's main objective. for example creating the dependent classes.

    this itself does not explain much, basically we want loose coupling and the concept is similar to a factory pattern

2. DIP (_principle_) suggests that high-level modules should not be dependent on low-level modules but should depend on abstraction.

    so a filesystem class should implement on a disk abstraction rather than a disk class, in other words it should not have control over what disk it's gonna get

3. DI is a _pattern_ that implements IoC _principle_

4. The IoC Container is a framework that aims to automate the DI process. Such as the _Unity_ framework in .NET

    we cannot achieve loosely coupled classes by only using IoC _principle_ (as it doens't make much sense in itself)

## Inversion of Control

![if][icoflow]

form the graph, IoC can be achieved using Factory Pattern, example using __C++__

```C++
class Driver {
public:
    Driver() {
        // driver stuff
    }
};

class Car {
private:
    Driver driver;

public:
    Car(): driver(new Driver()) {}
    void Run(); // man functionality
};
```

in the first example class Car creates Driver, so other than the main function driving, it involves the additional control of creating the driver

IoC principle suggests to invert the control, which actually means:

* transfer the extra control stuff to another class

to link this with invert control, understand it like this

* invert the dependency creation control from `class Car` to another class

or just forget the invert and just remember moving the responsible of extra control to another function

```C++
class Driver {
public:
    void Drive();
}

class DriverFactory {
public:
    static Driver createDriver() {
        // create new driver return the interface
    }
};

class Car {
private:
    Driver driver;

public:
    Car() {
        driver = DriverFactory.createDriver();
    }

    void Run(); // man functionality
};
```

the responsibility of creating a driver is moved to another class, this decouples the Car from Driver, so factory to can anything when creating the object.

In summary the simple Factory Pattern is our solution for IoC, which is just

* transfer the exrta control functionality to another class, or formaly inverting the dependency of control to another class

## Dependency Inversion Principle

![idi][di]

DIP, roughly translates to interface

it literally says, high module should not depend on low level but rather on abstraction, abstraction can be directly translated to interface.

so how do we write code?

using previous example we only need to change a little code

```C++
class IDriver {
public:
    virtual void Drive() = 0;
}

class DriverFactory {
public:
    static IDriver createDriver() {
        // create new driver return the interface
    }
};

class Car {
private:
    IDriver driver;

public:
    Car() {
        driver = DriverFactory.createDriver();
    }

    void Run(); // man functionality
}
```

we now create driver abstractions instead of the actual driver, now the car don't even know what driver is using it, as long as it can drive. which decouples it even more

## Dependency Injection

![idc][dic]

now this section we are going to implement dependency injection, this is really simple, basically we are going to replace the factory with 3 different types of method.

before we start let's introduce some jargons

![idip][dipt]

[dipt]: images/dipat.JPG

so the jargons are

* Client Class: The class that needs the additional control
* Service Class: The class being injected
* Injector: The class that injects the Service into the Client

now this is clear, let's introduce our 3 methods of replacing the factory.

so, since we need to replace, we need to give reasons to why the factory was not enough

```C++
class IDriver {
public:
    virtual void Drive() = 0;
}

class DriverFactory {
public:
    static IDriver createDriver() {
        // create new driver return the interface
    }
};

class Car {
private:
    IDriver driver;

public:
    Car() {
        driver = DriverFactory.createDriver();
    }

    void Run(); // man functionality
}
```

now if we look back to this code snippet, the reason lies in the `DriverFactory` that was used in the `Car` class. In some way we are still exposing the dependency inside our class, consider if we need complicated logic to determine our runtime Driver, if you are to design a factory that can return many kinds of drivers, what is a feasible way to do the logic?

```C++
static IDriver createDriver() {
    if (...)
        return CarPooler();
    else if (...)
        return Learner();
    else ...
}
```

the most feasible way might be using an input parameter, an enum to determine, than this means our `Car` may need to pass in some `enum`, this means if we want a different driver we end up changing code inside our `Car` class. this is not what we want.

thus comes this thing called dependency injection. Don't fret, it's very simple logic

basically there's 3 types Dependency Injection purposed to replace factory pattern

1. Constructor Injection

    In this method we Injection through the `Constructor` of our client class.

    ```C++
    class Car {
    private:
        IDriver driver;

    public:
        Car(IDriver driver): driver(driver) {
        }

        void Run(); // man functionality
    }
    ```

    this way we completely throw away the responsiblity to an outer class. If eventually any change happen to the driver there is nothing we need to change in `Car`

2. Method Injection

    We inject through a method, which means setting the value of the interface through a setter function.

    ```C++
    class Car {
    private:
        IDriver driver;

    public:
        Car() {
        }

        void setDriver(IDriver driver) {
            this.driver = driver;
        }

        void Run(); // man functionality
    }
    ```

    now, why do we need this? it's exactly the same as we did in constructor but just delayed the setting and also cost us another constructor run on `driver`

    imagine if our `Car` is also an interface

    ```C++
    class ICar {
    public:
        virtual void setDriver(IDriver driver) = 0;
    }

    class Car : public ICar {
    private:
        IDriver driver;

    public:
        Car() {
        }

        void setDriver(IDriver driver) {
            this.driver = driver;
        }

        void Run(); // man functionality
    }
    ```

    so now by exposing the `setDriver` function in the interface we have a general setter for every kind of `ICar`, which decouples the setting with the actual instance of `Car`

3. Property Injection

    you have a public field in the class and you set it. I don't know why we have this tbh. maybe if we just want to delay the setting of the interface but not the decoupling. As in when our car is not an interface so we don't want to waste our resource on the setter function.

## IoC Container

IoC Container implement DI to achieve loose coupled class. It's a _framework_ for automatic DI.

IoC Container creates an object of the specific class and injects all the dependency objects through Constructor, Property or Method at runtime and dispose them at the appropiate time

a typical IoC Container contains the following DI lifecycle

1. Register: Registering the type and interface with the container, or jargon words registering the services
2. Resolve: Resolving a Client with injection applied
3. Dispose: life time manager to manage an object's lifecycle and dispose it (for example manage the lifetime of a instance in a container)

an Example in C# is the Unity Container

### Unity Container

Unity Container provides `RegisterType` and `Resolve` methods

obviously `RegisterType` registers the service

```C#
container.RegisterType<ICar, Audi>();
```

`Resolve` creates your client with injection applied

```C#
var Driver = container.Resolve<Driver>(); // resolves an Driver class with Audi injected for ICar
```

`RegisterInstance` registers an instance for the service instead of creating a new instance for every injection

```C#
container.RegisterInstance<ICar>(new Audi()); // doens't create new instance for ICar
```

#### Injection Methods

use `InjectionConstructor` to pass in parameters for Client class when resolving from the Container

e.g.

```C#
public class Car : ICar{
    public Car(string name) {}
}

container.RegisterType<ICar, Car>(new InjectionConstructor("Audi"));
```

or

```C#
public class Driver {
    public Driver(ICar car, string name) {}
}

container.RegisterType<Driver>(new InjectionConstructor(container.Resolve<ICar>(), "name"));
```

basically resolve can Resolve class with Injection or class that's been registered

so similar to `InjectionConstructor` there are `InjectionProperty` and `InjectionMethod` for property accessor and setter methods, which isnt' really important so I can just reference it when needed

also there are `attributes` associated with these so....

#### Lifetime Managers

lastly, we have use lifetimemanager to control the lifetime of the Injections

![itm][tm]

Difference between `ContainerControlledLifeTimeManager` and `RegisterInstance` is that when we `RegisterInstance` the object is created on spot whereas `ContainerControlledLifeTimeManager` delays the creation to when it's first injected
